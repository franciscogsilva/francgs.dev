# Solving Docker Permission Issues in Node.js Projects: A Guide to Overcoming EACCES Errors in Volumes

## Introduction

When working with Docker in Node.js projects, encountering permission errors, especially when using volumes for databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL, is common. A typical error might look like this:

```
[Error: EACCES: permission denied, scandir '/home/username/Development/project/postgres-test']
```


This tutorial will explain how to resolve this permissions issue, ensuring that Docker volumes are not created with root permissions.

## Problem Explained

The `EACCES` error occurs when attempting to access a directory or file for which you do not have the appropriate permissions. In the context of Docker and Node.js, this often happens with database volumes, which are created with root permissions by default, preventing normal user access or modification.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Preparation

Ensure you have Docker and Node.js installed. You should have a `docker-compose.yml` file for your project.

### Step 2: Obtain UID and GID

Identify your UID (user identifier) and GID (group identifier) on your system:

- Open a terminal.
- Run `id -u` to get your UID.
- Run `id -g` to get your GID.
- Note these numbers for later use.

### Step 3: Modify Docker Compose

Update your `docker-compose.yml` to use the `user` option, specifying your UID and GID.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongo-db:
    image: mongo:latest
    user: "<your_uid>:<your_gid>"
    volumes:
      - ./mongo-data:/data/db
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:latest
    user: "<your_uid>:<your_gid>"
    volumes:
      - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

Replace `<your_uid>` and `<your_gid>` with your UID and GID values.

### Step 4: Rebuild and Run Containers

- Run `docker compose down` to stop and remove the current containers.
- Run `docker compose up` -d to start the containers with the updated configuration.

### Step 5: Verification
Check that the `mongo-data` and `postgres-data` directories on your host have the correct permissions and that the `EACCES` error has been resolved.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively resolve Docker permission problems in Node.js projects, preventing errors like `EACCES` when accessing database volumes and enhancing security in your development environment.
