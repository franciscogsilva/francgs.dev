Over two intense days, we developed a mobile prototype noted for its innovation, teamwork, adaptability, and effective use of Avaya's CPaaS platform. This achievement underscores my ability to innovate and execute under pressure.",
        "As a technical leader and mobile developer, I worked on a financial project for Financiera Comultrasan.

I applied unit testing with Jasmine and adopted design patterns such as Clean Architecture and the adapter pattern, which are crucial for financial applications. I implemented encryption in all API Rest communications to reinforce security. Additionally, I led the integration of DevOps for CI/CD in GitLab, using Fastlane for automated deployment to Google Play Store and App Store."
