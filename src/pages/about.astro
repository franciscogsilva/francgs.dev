      </h1>
      <p>My name is <strong>Francisco González</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        As a software developer with <strong class="text-secondary"
          >+8 years of experience</strong
        >, I have honed my skills in the analysis, design, development, testing,
        deployment, and management of technology solutions across cloud and
        mobile platforms. My leadership capabilities have been demonstrated over
        <strong class="text-secondary">+3 years</strong>, guiding development
        teams with expertise certified by CMMI.

      <p>
        My first job was at a small <em>(and really cool)</em> software factory in
        my hometown, where I learned how to design and build Laravel, Angular, and
        Web applications with a robust backend system from scratch. In this small
        company I achieved my first great achievement as a professional, <strong
          >🏆 1st place</strong
        > in the <a

          >Ministry of TIC's virtual hackathon Animalapp</a
        >. Then I worked for a company in Spain 🇪🇸 where I learned about SMS and
        multichannel messaging systems for very large companies. I currently
        work for A&A Soluciones TIC as Technical Leader and Senior Software
        Developer, where we have achieved <strong>🏆 1st place</strong> in the <a
